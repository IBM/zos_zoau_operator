**Z Open Automation Utilities Operator collection**
========================

The **IBM® Z® Open Automation Utilities Operator collection** provides automation for installing the ZOAU language on one or more z/OS endpoints and managing its lifecycle in a hybrid Cloud environment. The ZOAU operator makes use of the **z/OS Package Manager** to install the software on to z/OS and manage its lifecycle.


Import this collection into an instance of **z/OS Cloud Broker** running in RedHat OpenShift Container Platform to get started quickly. **z/OS Cloud Broker** generates a Kubernetes operator, making it easy to deploy ZOAU to a z/OS endpoint.
